# Professional Portfolio WIP

Since the last portfolio repo I've refactored my code. Some of my positioning was hard coded when I last submitted this assignment. Now I've reduced the amount of class and styled similar elements with the same code. For now, I am using jQuery as a hover over and click action-er for the Furiendr project figure.

And have updated my first project with Furiendr.
