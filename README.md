# Professional Portfolio WIP

2-17-22:

I have updated my project 2 link to feature our most recent group project. I have also updated my LinkedIn and resume to include this coding bootcamp into my education. My github profile now has three pinned repos, and I have updated the event listeners to Furiendr and Ponder to assign the browser location instead for replace. This allows for the user to go back on their browser.

Since the last portfolio repo I've refactored my code. Some of my positioning was hard coded when I last submitted this assignment. Now I've reduced the amount of class and styled similar elements with the same code. For now, I am using jQuery as a hover over and click action-er for the Furiendr project figure. I have also updated my resume, LinkedIn, and GitHub profile link.

And have updated my first project with Furiendr.
